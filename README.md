# Sequence-Based-Classification-of-Antimicrobial-Small-Proteins-Using-Deep-Learning
Overview

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global health challenge, motivating the search for novel antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial small proteins (AMSPs, 50–150 amino acids) are an underexplored class with therapeutic potential.

This repository provides a deep learning framework for AMSP classification using Evolutionary Scale Modeling (ESM) embeddings. We evaluate multiple neural architectures, pooling strategies, and loss functions under rigorous redundancy reduction and cross-validation.

Our results show that ESM embeddings contain strong predictive signal for antimicrobial classification, with models achieving a mean AUC of 0.900 ± 0.035 across 200 experiments, and 60% of models exceeding an AUC of 0.9.
